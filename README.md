# Polynomial_Long_Division_GUI
This is a GUI app that computes the result of polynomial long division up to a limit specified by the user. Most online long division calculators are unable to provide this functionality.

The user has to enter the numerator, denominator and the required number of quotients.

This calculator can provide an arbitrary number of quotients. Moreover, decimal input for the polynomials is also accepted. This GUI app is written mostly in C++17 with the use of Qt framework. A backend algorithm was written in C++ to cpmpute polynomial long division which took user input from the command line, that algorithm was refiened and turned into a GUI.
